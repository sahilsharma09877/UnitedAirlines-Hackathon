Call Center Performance Optimization for United Airlines

Project Overview
This project aims to optimize United Airlines' call center performance by improving Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The analysis identifies inefficiencies and proposes solutions, including IVR automation, agent training, and proactive communication.

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Analysis: Cleaned and merged datasets (calls, customers, reasons, sentiment) to calculate AHT and AST.
AHT & AST Insights: Identified key factors contributing to long AHT/AST (e.g., call reason, sentiment).
IVR Improvements: Suggested automating common issues (seating, baggage, booking) via IVR to reduce agent workload.
Machine Learning: Developed models to predict AHT and call escalations using regression.


Project Structure
/data/: Datasets used for analysis.
/src/: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
/reports/: Final presentation  report summarizing results.
